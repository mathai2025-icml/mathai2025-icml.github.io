# Overview

Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, studied by philosophers, logicians, and neuroscientists. It is a cyclical process of analyzing complex information, identifying patterns and relationships, drawing logical conclusions from evidence, and refining generalizations through refutations. 

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have reached a significant inflection point in mathematical reasoning, with models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Meanwhile, as mathematical problem solving benchmarks start to saturate, more challenging targets are currently being explored. However, models have made considerable progress on these benchmarks, and there is still a long way to go when it comes to using AI for these expert-level mathematics tasks. At the same time, advancements in LLMs have triggered a paradigm shift in the broader intersection of artificial intelligence and experimental mathematics, giving rise to novel methods for generating conjectures, proving theorems, and fostering new forms of humanâ€“machine collaboration in mathematical discovery.

Our proposed workshop focuses on the intersection of deep learning, experimental mathematics, and mathematical reasoning, with a particular emphasis on leveraging the recent progress made with large language models. Our guiding theme is:

*"How can AI be used to expand the boundaries of human discoveries in mathematics?"*

In pursuing this question, we aim to bridge the gap between computer scientists and mathematicians, moving beyond toy-datasets towards exploring genuine applications in research-level mathematics. This year, we have confirmed speakers working in AI, pure mathematics, and a combination of both. Our objective is to foster a lively and constructive dialogue on areas including, but not limited, to the following:

- **AI for mathematical problem solving**: Building off of the success of today's frontier models, how can we leverage LLMs to solve problems at the college level and beyond?
- **AI for mathematical discovery**: How can modern deep learning methods uncover new patterns, confirm or refute conjectures, and enable high-precision computation while remaining interpretable and offering strong generalization? Can AI assist with research-level mathematics?
- **Human-AI collaboration in mathematics**: While machines are great at large-scale pattern recognition, humans are able to think more abstractly and develop intuition. How can humans and machines complement each other productively?
- **Measuring progress in mathematics**: How do we design benchmarks that push the frontier of what LLMs are able to do when it comes to mathematics? What are the milestones in AI for math?
