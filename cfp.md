# Call for Papers


Our workshop focuses on the intersection of deep learning, experimental mathematics, and mathematical reasoning, with a particular emphasis on leveraging the recent progress made with large language models. Our guiding theme is:

*"How can AI be used to expand the boundaries of human discoveries in mathematics?"*

In pursuing this question, we aim to bridge the gap between computer scientists and mathematicians, moving beyond toy-datasets towards exploring genuine applications in research-level mathematics. This year, we have confirmed speakers working in AI, pure mathematics, and a combination of both. Our objective is to foster a lively and constructive dialogue on areas including, but not limited, to the following:

- **AI for mathematical problem solving**: Building off of the success of today's frontier models, how can we leverage LLMs to solve problems at the college level and beyond?
- **AI for mathematical discovery**: How can modern deep learning methods uncover new patterns, confirm or refute conjectures, and enable high-precision computation while remaining interpretable and offering strong generalization? Can AI assist with research-level mathematics?
- **Human-AI collaboration in mathematics**: While machines are great at large-scale pattern recognition, humans are able to think more abstractly and develop intuition. How can humans and machines complement each other productively?
- **Measuring progress in mathematics**: How do we design benchmarks that push the frontier of what LLMs are able to do when it comes to mathematics? What are the milestones in AI for math?

### Submission Requirements

Submissions to MATH-AI 2025 are limited to 4 pages of content, but may contain an unlimited number of pages for references and appendices. The latter may not necessarily be read by the reviewers. We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings, reproducibility information, etc.) that do not fit in the 4 pages. The review process is double-blind, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately anonymised.

All submissions must be formatted with LaTeX using the [ICML paper format](img/icml2025.zip).

All accepted papers will be presented in an in-person poster session, and some will be selected for oral presentation. We also permit papers that have been recently published or are under submission to another venue. Please mark such papers accordingly upon submission. The page limit for these submissions is 4 pages. Accepted papers will be displayed on the MATH-AI 2025 homepage, but are to be considered non-archival.

Submission Link: TBD

### Camera-ready Requirements

The final version of all accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewersâ€™ comments can be taken into account.
